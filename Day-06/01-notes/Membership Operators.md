Membership Operations in Python
Introduction
Membership operators in Python are used to check whether a value is present in a sequence or collection, such as a list, tuple, or string. The membership operators are "in" and "not in."

List of Membership Operators
in: Returns True if the left operand is found in the sequence on the right.
not in: Returns True if the left operand is not found in the sequence on the right.
Examples
in Operator
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
result = "banana" in fruits
# result will be True
not in Operator
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
result = "yellow" not in colors
# result will be True
