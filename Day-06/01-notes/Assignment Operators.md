Assignment Operations in Python
Introduction
Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. They include the basic assignment operator (=) and various compound assignment operators that perform an operation on the variable while assigning a value.

List of Assignment Operators
Basic Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.

Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

Division Assignment (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

Floor Division Assignment (//=): Performs floor division on the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

Modulus Assignment (%=): Calculates the modulus of the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

Exponentiation Assignment (=):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

Examples
Basic Assignment
x = 5
Addition Assignment
y = 10
y += 3  # Equivalent to y = y + 3
