Logical Operations in Python
Introduction
Logical operators in Python are used to manipulate and combine Boolean values. These operators allow you to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.

List of Logical Operators
AND (and): Returns True if both operands are True.
OR (or): Returns True if at least one of the operands is True.
NOT (not): Returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.
Examples
AND Operator
x = True
y = False
result = x and y
# result will be False
OR Operator
a = True
b = False
result = a or b
# result will be True
