Relational Operations in Python
Introduction
Relational operators in Python are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a Boolean result, which is either True or False.

List of Relational Operators
Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.

Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.

Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

Less than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

Examples
Equal to
a = 5
b = 5
result = a == b
# result will be True
Not equal to
x = 10
y = 7
result = x != y
# result will be True
