Arithmetic Operations in Python
Introduction
Arithmetic operators in Python allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values. These operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

List of Arithmetic Operators
Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand (results in a floating-point number).
Floor Division (//): Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
Exponentiation ():** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
Examples
Addition
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print(result)  # Output: 8
Subtraction
x = 10
y = 7
result = x - y
print(result)  # Output: 3
